<p>Enjoy a leisurely weekend bunch with these taco-inspired pancakes filled with bacon, cheese and scrambled eggs</p>
<h>Ingredients</h>
<ul>
    <li>100g streaky bacon</li>
    <li>125g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>10g golden cast sugar</li>
    <li>15g butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>125ml milk</li>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp oil</li>
    <li>2g chives, finely chopped</li>
    <li>30g mature cheddar, grated</li>
</ul>
<h>Method</h>
<ol>
    <li>
        Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and arrange the bacon in a single layer on a baking tray. Bake for 12-14 mins until crisp. Meanwhile, combine the flour, baking powder and sugar in a bowl. Whisk the butter, vanilla, milk and egg together in a jug. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the wet mixture, whisking to combine. Be careful not to over-whisk – it’s fine if there are lumps.
    </li>
    <li>Heat a little of the oil in a non-stick pan over a medium heat. Spoon in 2 tbsp batter and spread out into a 12cm circle. Cook for 2-3 mins until the edge is set and golden. Flip and cook for 1-2 mins more until set. Repeat to make four pancakes, keeping finished pancakes warm in a low oven while you cook the next.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, for the maple butter, beat the ingredients together until smooth. For the scrambled eggs, whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt. Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Once foaming, pour in the beaten egg, cook, undisturbed, for 20 seconds, then stir and cook for 1-2 mins more until set, light and fluffy. Don’t stir too often – you don’t want to break up the eggs too much.</li>
    <li>Spread the maple butter over the pancakes, then top with the eggs, bacon, chives and cheese.</li>
